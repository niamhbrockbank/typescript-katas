# Trailing Zeros

**5kyu**
Taken from codewars, [see here for full instructions](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52f787eb172a8b4ae1000a34).

**Brief:**
Write a function that returns the number of trailing zeros for a given number's factorial.

**Tip:**
Factorials become very large, quickly (`1000!` has 2568 digits) so focus on making it an efficient algorithm.

## Examples

```
zeros(6) = 1
# 6! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 = 720 --> 1 trailing zero

zeros(12) = 2
# 12! = 479001600 --> 2 trailing zeros
```
