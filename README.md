# TypeScript Katas

A collection of interesting katas that I have completed in TypeScript. 

Use ```yarn``` on initial setup to load dependencies. <br />
Use ```yarn test``` to run jest tests that have been set up in all *.test.ts files. <br />
Use ```yarn run ts-node src/<filename>``` to run individual files. <br />
